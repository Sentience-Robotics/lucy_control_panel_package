# Lucy Control Panel Package
*REST API backend for managing robot joints via URDF files in ROS 2*

---

## üìå Overview

The Lucy Control Panel Package is a ROS 2 package that provides a REST API backend for the [Lucy Control Panel](https://github.com/Sentience-Robotics/lucy_control_panel) project. This package enables remote management and control of robot joints through a web-based interface by exposing robot capabilities via RESTful endpoints.

The package integrates with ROS 2's robot description framework, parsing URDF (Unified Robot Description Format) files to dynamically generate API endpoints for each controllable joint. This allows for real-time monitoring and control of robot actuators through HTTP requests, making it easy to integrate with web applications, mobile apps, or other external systems.

## üöÄ Features

- **REST API Server**: Embedded HTTP server providing RESTful endpoints for robot control
- **URDF Integration**: Automatic parsing of robot URDF files to discover available joints and capabilities
- **Joint Control**: Real-time position, velocity, and effort control for robot joints
- **Status Monitoring**: Live feedback on joint states, positions, and health status
- **ROS 2 Native**: Full integration with ROS 2 ecosystem including topics, services, and parameters
- **Web Interface Compatible**: Designed to work seamlessly with the Lucy Control Panel frontend
- **Configurable**: Flexible configuration options for different robot platforms and setups

## üõ†Ô∏è Installation & Usage

### Prerequisites

- ROS 2 (Humble or later)
- Python 3.8+
- Valid URDF file for your robot

### Installation

This setup uses the [lucy_devtools](https://github.com/Sentience-Robotics/lucy_devtools) repository to build the package.

```bash
# Clone the repository into your ROS 2 workspace
cd ~/lucy_/src
git clone https://github.com/Sentience-Robotics/lucy_control_panel_package.git

# Enter into the devtools ROS 2 workspace
Env launch
cd ~/lucy_ros2_ws

# Build the package
Make -b

# Source the workspace
source install/setup.bash
```

### Quick Start

```bash
# Launch the REST API server
ros2 run lucy_control_panel_package lucy_api_server

# In another terminal, launch the node with the following commands:
ros2 lifecycle get /lucy_api_server && \
ros2 lifecycle set /lucy_api_server configure && \
ros2 lifecycle set /lucy_api_server activate

# You can check the status of the node with:
ros2 lifecycle get /lucy_api_server
ros2 param get /lucy_api_server server_port
ros2 param get /lucy_api_server server_host

# The API will be available at http://localhost:8080
# Use with the [Lucy Control Panel](https://github.com/Sentience-Robotics/lucy_control_panel) frontend for full functionality
```
